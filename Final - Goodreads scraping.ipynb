    "- We're going to scrape Goodreads web site https://www.goodreads.com/list?ref=nav_brws_lists\n",
    "- We'll get a list of genres and its url first save it to a csv. \n",
    "- For each genre we'll get different book list types, no. of books and no. of voters. \n",
    "- For each Genre we got the first 30 book lists with their titles, url with number of books available and voters and saved it to a csv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 2: \n",
    "- We selected Childrens Genre and got the first 30 book list types and the first 100 books under each book list type\n",
    "- Each book will have the book title, Book url, Author, Avg Rating Total ratings, Book score and votes\n",
    "- Sved it into a csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3:\n",
    "- For each booklist type we'll create a CSV file in the following format:\n",
    "- Format: Book Title,Book url ,Author ,Average rating and Total Ratings ,Bookscore and votes\n",
    "- Example:  Harry Potter series box set,https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/862041.Harry_Potter_Series_Box_Set, J.K Rowling,  4.74 avg rating ‚ 273,511 Total ratings ,score:10,671,and 110 peoplevoted\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 4:\n",
    "- Getting the description took a lot of time so I took a particular genre Children and took a particular book list Best series under Childrens Genre and got descriptions only for those to save time and saved it into a csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 5:\n",
    "- Now using while loop and for loop i want to scrape book details from atleast first 3 pages under Childrens Genre and Booklist type: Picture books and save it to a csv file"
